A good design implementation is important for the end user experience, so we should be careful when implementing the design. To avoid some of the common mistakes, check out the [design implementation checklist](https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Design-implementation-checklist-ipkZQDB2AMLjzmVYyZkSC).

## Communication with designers

Making a great product is a common goal for developers and designers. When working towards this goal, some compromises might need to be made. This might be because of some technical limitations or because something would just take too long and wouldn't be worth it from the business perspective. If you notice a situation like this, talk to your designer and find the best compromise together.

When you get a new design for something, try to give feedback as soon as possible. That way, you give the designer enough time to address the feedback and have everything ready when the time comes to implement it. This should decrease need for synchronous communication and deadline issues.
