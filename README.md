# Frontend handbook

Our handbook based on 10 years of experience in Frontend/JS development. We try to document our way of working and writing code here. As this might change feel free to watch this space regularly.

## Contributing

We welcome all contributions from both the public and Infinum members. Feel free to open up the pull request with your ideas/articles/chapters, or what ever you want to see merged.

In recommended extensions you can find `vscode-remark`, which is used to check (lint) and format markdown files from within your editor, you should install it before working with chapters.

If you want to add a new chapter, you can do it in [frontend-handbook-private](https://github.com/infinum/frontend-handbook-private) repository `chapters.yml` file.
