Every project starts with a check list. The main idea behind this is to have a starting point which will help us catch mistakes and often forgotten points early.

When you have a go-ahead to start working on a project talk to your Team Lead or to your Lead Engineer to help you fill our a kick off list for the project on hand. You will yet need a few things before you start with this.

## Things you will have to know beforehand:

1. Who estimated the project and what technologies are required
2. Have design files (Figma e.g.) ready for both mobile and desktop (depending on the project)
3. Understand the requirements of the project (or have someone near by who understands it)
4. Start the Devops staging deploy process right away (and complete their checklist)

## Things after filling in the checklist:

- This will be a living document for you to use and update, any changes should be reflected and documented
- Make sure that when on boarding new people on the project you revisit the checklist with them, see if you've missed something
- Link the checklist in your project documentation

As a lead (or only) developer on the project it's your responsibility to complete, maintain, and vouch for the details in this list.
