A normal Angular application executes in the browser, rendering pages in the DOM in response to user actions. Angular Universal executes on the server, generating static application pages that later get bootstrapped on the client. This means that the application generally renders more quickly, giving users a chance to view the application layout before it becomes fully interactive.

## What is Server Side Rendering (SSR)?
Server-side rendering (SSR) is an applicationâ€™s ability to convert HTML files on the server into a fully rendered HTML page for the client. The web browser submits a request for information from the server, which instantly responds by sending a fully rendered page to the client.

## Why we use Server Side Rendering (SSR)?
There are 3 reasons for create angular application with server side rendering.
1. Search engine optimization (SEO).
2. Improve performance on web and mobile.
3. Load the page quickly.
