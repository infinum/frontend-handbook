Design your components to be as small as possible and reuse them as much as possible. Philosophically, components can be divided into two types:

- Presentational (dumb)
  - in charge of displaying the data which is passed down to them
  - should not make use of services
  - pass events up instead of doing complex things with them
  - use `changeDetection: ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush` in the `@Component` declaration
- Container (smart)
  - use multiple (if necessary) other components
  - serve data to presentational components
  - handle events from child components
  - control UX flow
  - work with services to make things happen (fetch, store, change state)
  - can be loaded directly or lazily when routing
  - use `changeDetection: ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush` and pass data down using the `async` pipe

It is ok to have multiple levels of nesting of container components if it is necessary.

More on this philosophy can be found in various online articles. Some articles have framework-specific information, but the core concepts apply no matter which framework you use. A good article from Angular University on this topic: [Angular Architectureâ€”Smart Components vs Presentational Components](https://blog.angular-university.io/angular-2-smart-components-vs-presentation-components-whats-the-difference-when-to-use-each-and-why/).
