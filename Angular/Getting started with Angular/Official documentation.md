[The official Angular documentation](https://angular.dev/overview) has a lot of information. There are some assumptions about prior knowledge required to understand the docs, so you should first get to know HTML, CSS, and modern JavaScript (+ TypeScript basics).

# Tutorials

There are two tutorial-style sections in the official docs.

## Getting Started with Angular: Learn Angular in your browser

This section covers all the steps you need to complete before you can start making your first app. It also covers the very basics of Angular's core features, including template syntax, component design, routing, dependency injection, working with forms, and a simple deployment process.

[Official docs](https://angular.dev/essentials) are a great resource for your first introduction to Angular and we recommend following all of the steps from this section. Tutorial section provides an interactive and [online integrated development environment](https://angular.dev/tutorials/learn-angular). It is very important that you actually write codeâ€”do not just read or copy/paste it, write it.

## Build your first Angular app

After you cover the basics, you can start by building your first [app](https://angular.dev/tutorials/first-app). This tutorial introduces some concepts and best practices which we use in everyday development. This time you will not use StackBlitz (online IDE), you will develop everything on your local machine. Just like before, it is important that you follow the tutorial and **write the code**.

This tutorial includes links to various other sections of the documentation; for example, the [Dependency Injection guide](https://angular.dev/guide/di). While these links are important resources, we recommend you do not open those links quite yet because a lot of those resources are large documents and they might distract or overwhelm you. First finish the tutorial and then come back to those links in order to deepen your understanding of the topics covered by the tutorial.

# Guides

After you finish the tutorial you will no doubt be left with questions. These guides, alongside your mentor, can help you find those answers.

Here are some of the most important guides:

- [Dependency Injection in Angular](https://angular.dev/guide/di)
- [Routing & Navigation](https://angular.dev/guide/routing)
- [Forms](https://angular.dev/guide/forms)
- [Animations](https://angular.dev/guide/animations)
- [Testing](https://angular.dev/guide/testing)
- [Signals](https://angular.dev/guide/signals)

Most of these are quite large documents. Nobody expects you to read through and memorize all of the content of all of these documents. But you should know they are there, so you can come back to them when you are unsure of how some things work. Even the most experienced developers use the documentation pages on a regular basis to remind themselves of some parts of the framework which they might not have used as extensively in a while so they need a refresher.
