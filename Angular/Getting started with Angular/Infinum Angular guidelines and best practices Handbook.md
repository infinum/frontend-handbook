The official docs are a great source of reference information, guides, and tutorials. After you finish the official tutorials, take a look at our very own [Angular Handbook](/handbook/books/frontend/angular/angular-guidelines-and-best-practices/core-libraries-configuration-and-tools). At first we recommend you skim-read it on a high-level, just to get to know which topics are covered. Of course, feel free to read it completely if you have the time.

The Handbook covers some of the best practices and formatting preferences to which we try and adhere when possible. This includes:

- Scaffolding
- File organization
- Tooling
- Editor and editor extensions recommendations
- RxJS basics
- Ways to conceptually organize components
- Handling multiple deployment environments
- Formatting, naming and best practices in Angular templates and TypeScript
- Dependency injection links
- Angular universal links
- Two-way binding
- Working with forms
- Testing
- And more...

One of the topics which is usually not covered in detail in most online tutorials is testing. A large portion of the Handbook is about [testing](/handbook/books/frontend/angular/angular-guidelines-and-best-practices/testing) and this should come in very handy once you start working on an actual project where it might be required to write tests.
