Completing official tutorials and reading some of the guides from the official documentation should teach you enough to start working on a real project. To advance your knowledge from this point forward, there are many great websites, YouTube channels and blogs you can follow. As you bump into parts of the framework where it is not clear what is going on, there is a good chance that a quick web search will lead you to one of these sources:

- [Angular University](https://angular-university.io/) has tons of PDFs and video content
- [Angular In Depth](https://indepth.dev/angular/) usually covers more advanced topics, so it is probably not a great first resource for beginners, but it will definitely be of great value when you have some very specific questions
- Subscription-based learning portals like [egghead.io](https://egghead.io/) have courses covering a wide range of topics
