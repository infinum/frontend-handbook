Angular is a big framework and there is a lot to cover when getting started. We have put together a short guide with links to resources which should help you.

Please read through this short getting started guide in its whole and then start opening the links on your journey to learn Angular ðŸ’ª.

If you have a mentor guiding you through your learning process, you are encouraged to also discuss any topic with them.

*Guides are not rules and should not be followed blindly. Use your head and think.*
