If you're searching for the tutorial to kick off learning React, you could first check [the official docs](https://react.dev/).

## Learn concepts

In case you're a type of person which prefers to learn the concepts before typing any code, head to [Learn React](https://react.dev/learn) which covers basic principles of React, but also dives in advanced topics like [managing state](https://react.dev/learn/managing-state), and [escaping hatches](https://react.dev/learn/escape-hatches). You should also see [Rules of React](https://react.dev/reference/rules) to help you write well organized, safe, and composable applications.

We recommend to check the basic principles first and have that settled in before exploring advanced features.

## Learn by doing

And for those who prefer learning by typing their own code, visit [Tutorial: Tic-Tac-Toe](https://react.dev/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe) which explores React concepts by building a tic-tac-toe game. This will cover all you need to know in a couple steps:

* [Setup](https://react.dev/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe#setup-for-the-tutorial)
* [Overview](https://react.dev/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe#overview)
* [Completing the game](https://react.dev/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe#completing-the-game)
* [Adding time travel](https://react.dev/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe#adding-time-travel)

And for best learning experience, feel free to combine the two approaches and have some fun as well. Don't forget to check out [other useful resources](/books/frontend/react/other-useful-resources) to expand your knowledge even further.
