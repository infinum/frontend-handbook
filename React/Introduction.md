## React

[React](https://reactjs.org/) is not a framework, it is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It's component based meaning that by assembling simple building blocks - components, you can make a complex UI.
With React you will use declarative programming paradigm for building component based systems which could be reused anywhere.
