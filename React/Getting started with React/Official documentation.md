If you're searching for the tutorial to kick off learning React, you could first check [the official docs](https://reactjs.org/docs).


## Learn concepts
In case you're a type of person which prefers to learn the concepts before typing any code, head to [main concepts](https://reactjs.org/docs/hello-world.html) which covers [basic principles](https://reactjs.org/docs/hello-world.html) of React, but also dives in [advanced topics](https://reactjs.org/docs/accessibility.html), [API](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-api.html), [hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) and [testing](https://reactjs.org/docs/testing.html). 

We recommend to check the basic principles first and have that settled in before exploring advanced features. 


## Learn by doing
And for those who prefer learning by typing their own code, visit [Intro to React: tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html#what-are-we-building) which explores React concepts by building a tic-tac-toe game. This will cover all you need to know in a couple steps:

- [Setup](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html#setup-for-the-tutorial)
- [Overview](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html#overview)
- [Completing the game](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html#completing-the-game)
- [Adding time travel](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html#adding-time-travel)

And for best learning experience, feel free to combine the two approaches and have some fun as well.
