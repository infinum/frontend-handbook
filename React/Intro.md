[React](https://reactjs.org/) is not a framework, it is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It's component based meaning that by assembling simple building blocks - components, you can make a complex UI.
With React you will use declarative programming paradigm for building component based systems which could be reused anywhere.

In the next few chapters we will cover everything from [styling components](/books/frontend/react/chakra-ui), through [folder structure](/books/frontend/react/project-structure) all the way to the [testing](/books/frontend/react/testing-best-practices). First take a look at the React [ecosystem](/books/frontend/react/ecosystem) used in our company, and after checking that out, start with [official documentation](/books/frontend/react/official-documentation) to get a grasp on the elementary concepts. Finish with our guide which will show you the best practices to utilize your new knowledge. Since there is a lot of information, give yourself time to have everything settled in and scroll through the handbook occasionally to repeat the advices that we showed you.

So letâ€™s get started ðŸ’ª ðŸ’ª
