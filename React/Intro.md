![React](/img/react.svg)

[React](https://reactjs.org/) is not a framework, instead it is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It is component based, meaning that by assembling simple building blocks - components - you can make a complex UI.
With React you will use the declarative programming paradigm for building component based systems which could be reused anywhere.

In the next few chapters we will cover everything from [styling components](/books/frontend/react/chakra-ui), through the [folder structure](/books/frontend/react/project-structure), all the way to [testing](/books/frontend/react/testing-best-practices). First take a look at the React [ecosystem](/books/frontend/react/ecosystem) used in our company, and afterwards start with the [official documentation](/books/frontend/react/official-documentation) to get a grasp on elementary concepts. This guide will show you best practices on how to utilize your new knowledge. Since there is a lot to cover, give yourself enough time for everything to sink in and revisit the handbook occasionally to refresh your knowledge.

So letâ€™s get started ðŸ’ª ðŸ’ª
