## README.md structure

```markdown
# Project name

* Productive project link
* Invision/Zepplin/Figma link
* Link to project wiki

## Project setup

Detailed documentation on how to get started with the project. This part usually
contains everything from `yarn install` to installing special tools like
`polyglot-cli` or `secrets-cli`.

Cover all cases and have a FAQ if needed. This should be as friendly as possible
to new developers joining the project.

## Deployment

Detailed documentation on where the project runs and how it's deployed. Can be
esp. useful if you use Docker or Passenger to host this site because this could
require you to have some special files/scripts in the project.

## Git workflow

Explain in detail how you work, what branches do you use, who is allowed to push
to what and when. Explain how PRs should be structured, how do you tie them to
work tickets in Productive/Jira.

## Styleguide

This project is using the styleguide as defined in the [Infinum Handbook v2020.09](link_to_tag) and [Styleguide Project v2020.09](link_to_tagged_project).
